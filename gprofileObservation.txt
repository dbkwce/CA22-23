Gprof is basically a profiling program which collects and arranges statistics of the 
program.
It looks into each of the functions present in the code and collect the timing 
information and for how many times that particular function was called.
    From my observation,I think we can not decide the sequence of functions executed 
in the program using gprof.

    Complexity of the Quick sort algorithm:-

Basically complexity of quick sort can be divided into two types.
They are as follows:

A]Time complexity
    Here time complexity can be again divided into three phases according to the case 
generated.
1.Best case:
    The best case in quick sort algorithm is when pivot element is the middle element 
or near to the middle element.So time complexity for this case is O(n*log n).

2.Average case:
    It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order.The average case time complexity
of quick sort algorithm is O(n*log n).

3.Worst case:
    It occurs when pivot is either the smallest or the greatest element from the list.
Time complexity for worst case is O(n^2).

B]Space complexity:
    The space complexity of quick sort algorithm is O(n*log n).
