Problem statement:
 Image Compression Using Vector Quantization and Encoding using Huffman Encoding
 To use the Vector Quantization Algorithm to compressed an image. Get the Huffman code of the input image using Huffman Encoding Algorithm.


Performance: 
1] Image.png : Dimensions: 128x128 px
               Size: 48 kB

2] compressimg.png : Dimensions: 80x78 px 
                     Size: 35 kB

3] Vector Quantization Algorithm: By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 
                                  Compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                    = ( 48 / 35 )
                                                    = 1.3714

Huffman Encoding Time Complexity:   

1] Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of unique characters.

2] If there are n nodes, extractMin() is called 2*(n â€“ 1) times. ExtractMin() takes O(logn) time as it calles minHeapify(). So, overall complexity is O(nlogn).
