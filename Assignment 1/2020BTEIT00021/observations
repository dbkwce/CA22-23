Q- Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?

Ans- No, we can't decide the sequnence of functions executed from gprof because all the function entries those are 
     there on gprof are not in sequence as they called. They are arranged according to the time taken by them in sorted order.
     
     
    
Q- Time complexity analysis of the quick sort.

Ans- Time complexity of entire recursion tree = Number of levels * Time taken for one level
    = n/2^k = 1                            
    = n = 2^k
    = log n = k log 2                     In best case, the partition forms at the exact middle.
    = k = log
    = log n*n
    Best Case: O(nlogn)
    
    Average Case: O(nlogn)
    
    
    Worst Case: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .....n    In worst case, the partition formed is at the ends.
    = n(n+1)/2 -1
    = n^2 + n
    = O(n^2)
