1)
 	No, because it only shows the Time spent on the Function and its Children and the Number of times the Function is called Recursively and Non Recursively. 
	But there is no Indication of the Sequence of the functions.

2)
	Best Case for the Quicksort occurs, when the Sorted Position of the Pivot is in the Middle of the Array, then Divide it in 2 equal array hence it require log(n) time,
	for n elements. Therefore here the Time Complexity is O(nlog(n)).

	Worst Case for the Quicksort occurs, when the Sorted Position of the Pivot is any end of the Array, then it can't divide the array. Hence require n time for n elements.
	Therefore here the Time Complexity is O(n^2).

	For Average Case O(nlog(n)) is the TIme Complexity.
