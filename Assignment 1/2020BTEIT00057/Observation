 Time Complexity:= 
   		   1]Average= O(N*logN);  When we divide array approximately into 2 equal halves, that is by taking pivot as the middle element.
 		   2]Worst case= O(N^2);  When we take pivot elemet as the end element in the array.
 		   
Space Complexity = Worst case : O(n)  Best case : O(logn)

 We cannot decide sequence of functions executed from gprof , the gprof file shows only any times the functions were called.
