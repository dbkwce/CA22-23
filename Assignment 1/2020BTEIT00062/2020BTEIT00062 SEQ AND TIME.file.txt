(2) Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?

    No, we can't decide the sequnence of functions executed from gprof because all the function entries those are there on gprof are not in sequence as they called.
    They are arrange according to the time taken by them in sorted order.
    
(3) Time complexity analysis of the quick sort.

    Time complexity of entire recursion tree = Number of levels*Time taken for one level
    => n/2^k = 1
    => n = 2^k
    => log n = k log 2
    => k = log
    => log n*n
    Best Case: O(n*logn)
    
    Worst Case: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .....n
    => n(n+1)/2 -1
    => n^2 + n
    => O(n^2)
    
    Average Case: O(logn)
