Observation :

Here as we increase the value of n then the time required to execute the program increases.
This means 
n is directly proportional to the time required to execute the program.
For lower values of n, the time required to execute the program is less(for example if value of n is 10 then the execution time is nearly 0).
For higher values of n, the time required to execute the program is more.
Here I have taken value of n as 10000 then the time required to execute the program is in the output.txt file.
It also shows us about how many times an functon is called and how much time it has been taken to execute the function.

About time and space complexicity
Here the Best time complexicity of program is O(n*log(n)) and the worst time complexicity of program is O(n^2).
Also the average time complexicity of program is O(n*log(n)).
The space complexicity of program is O(n*log(n)).
