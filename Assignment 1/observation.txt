
1. yes,we can decide the sequence of function of algorithm executed from the gprof by analyzing call graph present in gmon.out file.
by observing the call graph we can understand which function is called for how much amount of time and further it calls which other functions.
The call graph shows how much time was spent in each function and its children. From this information, you can find functions that, 
while they themselves may not have used much time, called other functions that did use unusual amounts of time


2. Time complexity of quicksort :-

Best Case Complexity - In Quicksort, the best-case occurs when the pivot element is the middle element or near to the middle element. 
The best-case time complexity of quicksort is O(nlogn).

Average Case Complexity - It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending.
 The average case time complexity of quicksort is O(nlogn).

Worst Case Complexity - In quick sort, worst case occurs when the pivot element is either greatest or smallest element. 
Suppose, if the pivot element is always the last element of the array, the worst case would occur 
when the given array is sorted already in ascending or descending order. 
The worst-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n2).
