Observation:

1. Time required to sort the array is directly
    proportional to the size of array.
2. In the example,
    when size of array is 10: 
        number of swapping = 18
        number of times partition is called = 6

    when size of array is 100: 
        number of swapping = 452
        number of times partition is called = 65

    when size of array is 1000: 
        number of swapping = 6115
        number of times partition is called = 661

3. Time complexity of QuickSort:
    Worst Case Time complexity, if the given array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order
    i.e. O(n^2)
    Best and Average Case Time complexity : O(nlog(n))
