1)No,we can not decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof.
     In each output file entries of each table are sorted by time spent in the function and its subroutines.So we cannot decide sequence of function execution.

2)complexity of algorithm- It is measure of performance of algorithm.
                           Time complexity -measure of time required by algorithm to process 'n' size input.
                                           O(n logn) average
                                           O(n*n) worst case
                                           O(nlogn) best case
                           space complexity -measure of space required by algorithm to process 'n' size input.
                            O(logn)
                           Big O notation is used to represent algorithmic complexity
                           O(1)<O(logn)<O(√n)<O(n)<O(nlogn)<O(n2)<O(n3)<O(2n)<O(10n)<O(n!)
                           algorithm with less complexity considered as efficient.
3)output-It contains 

                           i)Flat profile :How many times each function got called, total times involved, sorted by time
                             consumed.

                           ii)Call-graph: Each function, who called it, whom it called, and how many times.
                           
                           iii)Index: Cross-reference of function names and gprof numbers. 
                          
4)number of comparisons in worst case 
                          =  n(n−1)/2
