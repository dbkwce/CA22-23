1. No we can't decide the sequence of function execution.
   Because in call graph, the functions are sorted according to the time spent while execution. So, we can't decide their order of execution.
   

2. Time complexity of quicksort :- Best case :- O(nlogn)
                                   Average case :- O(nlogn)
                                   Worst case :- O(n^2)
                                   
    Here, time complexity depends on the pivot element. 
a) In best case, the pivot would be median element.
b) In worst case, the pivot could be end element.

Time complexity :- 
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
  T(n/2) = 2T(n/4) + n/2
  T(n/4) = 2T(n/8) + n/4
  .          .        .
  .          .        .
  .          .        .
   T(1) = 1
So, levels will be n/(2^k) = 1
                   n= 2^k
                   k = logn

T(n) = n+ n+n+....log n terms 
So, O(nlogn) will be the best case time complexity
