Ques 1: If we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?
Ans. : No, we can't decide the sequence of functions executed from gprof. Since, gprof shows only the time for execution of functions and number of times functions called in the program.

Ques 2: Comment on the complexity of the algorithm.
Ans. : Suppose, n is the size of the array.

Time complexity in 

(a)Best Case: The best case time complexity of quick sort is O(nlogn). If the pivot element divides the array into two equal sub-arrays, then this would be the best case. 

(b)Average Case: The average case time complexity of quick sort is O(nlogn). 

(c)Worst Case: The worst case time complexity of quick sort is O(n). It occurs when the pivot element is choosen first or last in the sorted or reverse sorted.

Observation:

    Function       No. of calls
   
1. partition()         10
2. QuickSort()         5
3. main()              1


From the output, it is seen that partition() called 10 times i.e. complexity of O(n), whereas QuickSort() and main() called once.
