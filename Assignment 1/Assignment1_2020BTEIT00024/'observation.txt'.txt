1] If we can decide the sequence of funtions executed from 'gprof'
No,we cannot decide the sequence of function executed from gprof because all the function entries those are there on gprof
are not in sequence as they called.They are arrange according to the time taken by them in sorted order.

2]Time complexity:
 a)  Best case complexity=O(nlogn)
 b)  Average case complexity=O(nlogn)
 c)  Worst case complexity= O(n^2)

Space complexity= O(nlogn)
  

Interpretation:Quick sort is fast sorting algorithm that works by spiltting a large array of data into smaller sub-array.this
implies that each iteration works by splitting the input into two components,sorting them,and then recombining them. 

Observation:
The code got executed in less than 1 second but if we increase size of array then the execution time will increase.
