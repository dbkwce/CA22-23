The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks the greatest or smallest item as a temp and the complexity of Worst Case: O(N^2).

The best-case occurs when a partition process always picks the middle element as a temp. And the complexity of Best Case: O(N).

The average case means when there is neither a balanced tree nor the Worst Case. The complexity of the Average Case: (N log N).
