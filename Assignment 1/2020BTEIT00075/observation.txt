Que 1: If we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof'
Ans: Yes, we can decide the the sequemce of functions executed from gprof. Not only the sequence but we can get the runtime of everytime in percentage which helps to let know which function call is taking a large time and which is taking less time. And eventually this method helps us to optimize our code.

Que 2: Complexity of the algorithm
Ans: Best Case Complexity - In Quicksort, the best-case occurs when the pivot element is the middle element or near to the middle element. The best-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n*logn).
Average Case Complexity - It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending. The average case time complexity of quicksort is O(n*logn).
Worst Case Complexity - In quick sort, worst case occurs when the pivot element is either greatest or smallest element. Suppose, if the pivot element is always the last element of the array, the worst case would occur when the given array is sorted already in ascending or descending order. The worst-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n2).
