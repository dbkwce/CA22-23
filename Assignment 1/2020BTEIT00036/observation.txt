No we cannot decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof'
because the sequence of functions depend upon how we define our functions inside our program

No of function calls vs the value of n we provide it with :
n       no of function calls 
10		30 to 40 		     
100 	500 to 700		     
1000 	7000 to 9000		 
10000 	85000 to 125000		 


Complexity of the algorithm
omega : best case time complexity : n*logn
theta : average case time complexity : n*logn
big O : worst case time complexity : n*n

Space complexity : n*logn
