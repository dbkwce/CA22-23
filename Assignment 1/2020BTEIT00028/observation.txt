1)Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?

 we cannot decide the sequnence of function that are executed from 'gprof' because all 
the function entries are not in sequence as they called.
They are arranged according to the time taken by them in sorted order.


2)Complexity of the Algorithm.

i)Time Complexity:
The best case complexity is O(n*logn).
The average case complexity is also O(n*logn).
Worst case complexity is O(n^2).

ii)Space Complexity:	
	The space complexity in case of Quick sort is O(n*logn).
