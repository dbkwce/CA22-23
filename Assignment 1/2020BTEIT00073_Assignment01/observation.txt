(1)Time Complexity of Quick Sort Algorithm:

 For the best case, array would be sorted so there would be no swaps but still there be n*log n comparisons, provided size of input is n.
 Best Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
 Average Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)

(2)If We can decide Sequence of Algorithm:
 No, we can't decide the sequence of functions executed in gprof.
