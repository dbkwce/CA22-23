Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?

The sequence of functions executed from gprof can't be determined because the function 
entries on gprof are not in sequence as they were called.  Sorted by time taken, they are
arranged according to their time taken.
    
Time complexity analysis of the quick sort    
   
   Average Case: O(logn)
    
   Worst Case: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .....n
    => n(n+1)/2 -1
    => n^2 + n
    => O(n^2)
