2) Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?
    No we cannot decide sequence of function from gprof,because in gprof function are arrange according to time taken by them in sorted order.
    There they are not arrange according to which they are called. 
    
3) Time complexity analysis of the quick sort.

    Time complexity of entire recursion tree = Number of levels*Time taken for one level
    => n/2^k = 1
    => n = 2^k
    => log n = k log 2
    => k = log
    => log n*n
    Best Case:In best case the pivot element is at middle. 
    O(n*logn)
    
    Worst Case: In worst case the partitiom element is at end or at front so it need to traverse completly again to sort.
    So time complexity is time to reach all element.
    2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .....+ (n-1)+  n
    => n(n+1)/2 
    => n^2 + n
    => O(n^2)
    
    Average Case: O(nlogn)
