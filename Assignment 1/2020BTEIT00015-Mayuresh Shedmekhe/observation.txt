No, we cannot decide the sequence of functions to be executed from gprof call tree,as it describes table by total amount of time spent in each function.


# Complexity of this algorithm:
 
 Quicksort time complexity depends on the location of pivot and partiton of elements in array.
 1. In best case:
 	The time complexity of quicksort is : O(n*logn).
 	The best case time complexity occurs when the there is nearly equal partition in array
 	and when the pivot  element is the middle element or near to the middle element.
 	
 2. In average case:
	The time complexity of quicksort is :O(n*logn).
	The average case time complexity occurs when the array elements are in random order.
		
 3. In worst case:
 	The time complexity of quicksort is :O(n*n) .
 	The worst case occurs when the given array is already sorted
 	 
#Quicksort space complexity:

   Best case: O(logn).
   Worst case: O(n).
