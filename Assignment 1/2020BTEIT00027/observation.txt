Assignment 1


1. Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof'?

Observation-
	No, we can't decide the sequence of functions. 
	In 'gprog' functions are displayed according to the order they occur in the code.		
	'gprof' shows the time spent for each function and it's children and also the number of times each function is called.

2. Complexity of Quicksort algorithm:
	Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm.
	Time complexity of quicksort in best and average case is O(n*log n) and 
	in worst case it is O(n^2).
	Best case is when pivot is middle element.
	Average case is when elements are properly jumbled.
	Worst case is when the elements are already ascending or decending.
	
	Space complexity of quicksort algorithm is O(n*log n). n).
