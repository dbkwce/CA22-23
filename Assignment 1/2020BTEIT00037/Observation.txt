Observation:

    1.Can we decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof'
Ans- No, we can't be able to decide sequence of functions from gprof.
     We could able to know how much time it does take to execute all functions and their children functions.
     It also tells us about how many times each function is called or executed.


    2.Complexity of Quick Sort algorithm
Ans- Best case: O(N log(N))
	When element present in middle position of datalist is marked as a pivot value.
        In this case,datalist is get divided in 2 halves in each operation leading to log(n) for n input and for n times.
     
     Worst case: O(N^2)
	When smallest or largest element in datalist is get selected as a pivot,this senario occcurs.
        In this case,datalist will never get partitioned hence we have to do n steps n number of times.
