Answer 1]:No, we can't decide the sequence of functions executed in gprof. Here, gprof is only show the function execution time and how many time the function is call,
not showing sequence of function execution.

Answer 2]: Comment on the complexity of the algorithm - suppose n is the size of an array.



(1)Time Complexity of Quick Sort Algorithm:

 For the best case, array would be sorted so there would be no swaps but still there be n*log n comparisons, provided size of input is n.

 Best Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)(pivot element divide array into equal sub array).
 Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2).
 Average Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)(pivot element is choosen first or last in the sorted list).


Observations:

 

From this output, The following table shows the how many functions are call and how many times, and time for execution the function.
