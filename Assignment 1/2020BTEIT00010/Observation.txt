A. No, we cannot decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' cause we only see.



B. Time Complexity:

1.Quicksort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 
 
2.The best-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n*logn).

3.Average Case Complexity - It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending. 
  The average case time complexity of quicksort is O(n*logn).

4.Worst Case Complexity - In quick sort, worst case occurs when the pivot element is either greatest or smallest element. 
  Suppose, if the pivot element is always the last element of the array, the worst case would occur when the given array is sorted already in 
  ascending or descending order. The worst-case time complexity of quicksort is O(n2).



C. Comparison:
  1. For input 10 , comparision = 21
  2. for 100 , comparison = 330
  3. For 1000, comparison = 3746
  4. for 10000, caomparison = 37252



D. As we can see that maximum percentage of programs's time has been taken a partition function .
