Question:
Compute a total number of comparisons used in the program for 
different values of n (10, 100, 1000, 10000)
3. An 'observation.txt' text file containing your say on 
       - if we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' 
       - Comment on the complexity of the algorithm 

Solution:
The no of comparisons will be worst when the array is reverse sorted ie. for n sized array no of
comparisons will be n-1 so when 
n=10,then max no of comparisons will be 9,
n=100,then max no of comparisons will be 99,
n=1000,then max no of comparisons will be 999,
n=10000,then max no of comparisons will be 9999,
No, we can not decide the sequence of function executed from 'grop' 
but we can count the no of calls generated for each funciton in the algorithm.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n*logn) and the space complexity is O(n) where
is the no of elements to be sorted.
