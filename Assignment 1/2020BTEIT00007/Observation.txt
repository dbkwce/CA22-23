1] if we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' :
	
	generally functions are executed with depends upon the sequcence they are called, 
	so if we can change the order they are being called can affect the further data to be displayed in profiler output,
	and may be the ouput will be uncertain.
	
	So, the profiler always gives the output of the functions in a linear manner, and the data can be accurate.


2] Complexity of Quick sort algorithm
	
	a] Best case : 	O(n*logn)
	b] Average case : O(n*logn)
	c] Worst Case : O(n2)
