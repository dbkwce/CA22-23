Observation:

1.	When input given was small time taken was very less as comparisions were very fewer.

2.	It can be seen in gprof software tool using the commands.

3.	As input increases time taken for sorting with the quicksort approach increases as calling of function takes place several times.

4. No, we cannot decide the sequence. The functions are called as per the programme is written.

Conclusion:
1.The time taken to run the program completely is depend upon the number of inputs given.

2. 
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n*logn)
Average Case :O(n*logn)
Worst Case: O(n2)

3. 
Space Complexity: O(n*logn)
