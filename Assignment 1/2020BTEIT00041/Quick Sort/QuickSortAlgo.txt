Algorithm:

QuickSort is a type of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
It is based on dividing the array around a pivot element.

1. Select an element of array as a pivot element.
2. Iterate through the array using two pointers and swap them if
    element pointed by starting pointer is greater than pivot
    element pointed by end pointer is smaller than pivot.
    To make smaller elements one side and larger elements one side.
3. Stop the iteration when starting pointer exceeds end pointer.
4. Swap the pivot and end pointer value.
5. Repeat the above steps by dividing the array into two parts.
6. Select the pivot in each of those halves
7. Repeat the steps using recursion.

void QuickSort(array[],low,high)
{
    if(low<high)
    {
        pivot = partition(array,low,high);
        QuickSort(array,low,pivot-1);
        QuickSort(array,pivot+1,high);
    }
}

int partition(array[],low,high){
    pivot = array[high];
    indx = low -1;

    for(i = low ;i<=high -1 ;j++)
    {
        if(array[i]<pivot){
            indx++;
            swap array[indx] and array[i]
        }
    }

    swap array[indx+1] and array[high]

    return (indx+1)
}
