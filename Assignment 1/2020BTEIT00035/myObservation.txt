 Q.1st 
--> we can not decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' but we can have a count of number of function calls made by each of the functions.

Q.2nd
-->
Best case complexity : O(n*log(n)).
Worst case complexity : O(n^2).
Average case complexity : O(n*log(n)).

For some of the inputs  'n' observations are
for n=10, number of func. calls are 30 to 40.
for n=100, number of func. calls are 500 to 700.
for n=1000, number of func. calls are 6000 to 8000.
for n=10000, number of func. calls are 85000 to 125000.
