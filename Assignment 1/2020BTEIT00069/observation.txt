i) We observed that 'gprof' can show us the flow of execution of functons but we cannot decide the sequence of functions execution.

ii) In the given algorithm, the pivot will be left most element of an array or a part of given array. At every level,'n' elements will be compared for log(n) times if pivot is a middle element making Time Complexity O(nlogn) and that is also the best case of this algorithm but if array is already sorted or pivot is taken as a left side or right side element then 'n' elements will be compared for 'n' times making total Time Complexity O(n^2) which is its worst case. To solve the worst case issue either select the middle element as a pivot or a random element as a pivot.
