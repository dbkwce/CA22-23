VECTOR QUANTIZATION

Quantization is the process of approximating continuous data with discrete Data.
We use Vector Quantization for Image compression.
First we set the image data into an array of Vectors. Then make a lookup table we can either set it to
first few vectors or any random vectors from the data set.
Now compare the vectors and lookup table & maintain a Mapping array to map each vectors to it corresponding
Lookup tables Vector. Take average of individual elements and replace to with the nearest vector from 
the table. Do it for many iteration till the data change is very Low. The final data can be opened as image. 
Thus we get a compressed Image from a Normal Image.
