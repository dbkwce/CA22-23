Observation of huffman Encoding:

 The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length 
 code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). 
 The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency 
 of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
