Image compression using vector quantization.

	Vector quantization (VQ) is an efficient coding technique to quantize signal vectors.  A VQ compression procedure include codebook generation
	In codebook generation, similar vectors are grouped into clusters, and each cluster is assigned to a single representative vector called a codevector.Each input vector is then compressed by replacing it with the nearest codevector referenced by a simple cluster index. 
	The index of the matched codevector in the codebook is then transmitted to the decoder over a channel and is used by the decoder to retrieve the same codevector from an identical codebook. This is the reconstructed reproduction of the corresponding input vector. 
	Compression is thus obtained by transmitting the index of the codevector rather than the entire codevector itself.

The original size of the image is 749 KB
And the compressed size of the image is 79 KB
Image is compressed with compression ratio of 89.5% compression.

Huffman Coding Algorithm:
  	Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm
	Time Complexity of algorithm is O(nlogn)
