Topic: Image Compression Using Vector Quantization and Encoding using Huffman Encoding


Problem Statement: To use the Vector Quantization Algorithm to compressed an image.
                   Get the Huffman code of the input image using Huffman Encoding Algorithm.


1) Huffman file: 
   Huffman encoding algorithm

2) Images Folder:
   2 images:
   Original image: original.jpg
   Compressed image: final.jpg

3) Vector Quantization file: 
      i) This folder has the Vector Quantization Algorithm in it which is C++ language.
      ii) The source code is referred from a git repository.
      iii) Source.cpp provides two clones of the original image in compressed formed.

Performance: 

      Vector Quantization Algorithm: 

            By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 

                              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = ( 9.56/4.12 )
                                                =  2.32038 ~ (2.32)

      Huffman Encoding Algorithm:   

            The encoding performance for the Huffman is based on the number of various bits present inside the image.

            The Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree.
