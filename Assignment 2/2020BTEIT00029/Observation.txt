Performance: 
   By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 

                              compression ratio  = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
			     =171.7/114.2
			     =1.50


Huffman Encoding Time Complexity:   

          The time complexity for encoding each unique character based on its frequency is O(nlog n).
Extracting minimum frequency from the priority queue takes place 2*(n-1) times and its complexity is O(log n). Thus the overall complexity is O(nlog n).
