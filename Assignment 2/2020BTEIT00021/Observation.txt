 Huffman Encoding Algorithm:   

            The encoding performance for the Huffman is on the number of various bits present inside the image.

            The general Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree.
            
            
              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = (2.36/ 1.25)
                                                =  1.888
