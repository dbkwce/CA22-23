Topic: Image Compression Using Vector Quantization and Encoding using Huffman Encoding


Aim: To use the Vector Quantization Algorithm to compressed an 128x128 px image.
    Also get the Huffman code of the inputed image using Huffman Encoding Algorithm.



1) Images Folder:
      i) It has two images "gray.bmp" (original and uncompressed) and "gray_compressed.bmp" (original and commpressed).
      ii) Properties of "original.jpg" : 
                        Dimensions: 128x128 px
                        Size: 2.27 kB

      iii) Properties of "compressed.jpg" :
                        Dimensions: 90x90 px 
                        Size: 1.27 kB

2) VQ folder: 
      i) This folder has the Vector Quantization Algorithm in it which is C++ language.
      ii) The source code is referred from a git repository.
      iii) Source.cpp provides two clones of the original image in compressed formed.

Performance: 

      Vector Quantization Algorithm: 

            By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 

                              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = (2.27 / 1.27)
                                                =  1.80158 

            Thus VQ is one of the lossy compression algorithms and which is clearly visible by looking the compression ratio.

      Huffman Encoding Algorithm:   

            The encoding performance for the Huffman is on the number of various bits present inside the image.

            The general Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree.
