   Vector Quantization Algorithm: 
          Compression Ratio = 42%

Huffman Encoding Time Complexity:   

       Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of unique characters.
       If there are n nodes, extractMin() is called 2*(n â€“ 1) times. 
       extractMin() takes O(logn) time as it calles minHeapify(). So, overall complexity is O(nlogn).
