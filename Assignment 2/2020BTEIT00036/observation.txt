Vector Quantization is a technique which is used to compress data (images) . 

It works by dividing large set of points into smaller sections . 

The general TC of huffman encoding algorithm is O(nlogn) , where n is the number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree

Before compression : 22kb

After compression : 5kb
