vector quantization -----

  compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = (22.7 /3.62)
                                                 =6.27

encoding performance depends upon number of bits in the image,avg time complexity o(nlogn)



Huffman algo code:

      i) consist of the huffman.py file which is the  of the Huffman Algorithm. It gives the encoded image and bits values after the execution of algorithm.
      ii)  folder contains "Abhi.jpeg" image which is in th eform of grayscale image.
      iii) compressed.txt is the binary encoded image.which include all paths for bits inside image inputted.


inputted image -------- 128*128 pixels
                        size 22.7 kB


compressed image --------128*128 pixels
                         size 3.62 kB
