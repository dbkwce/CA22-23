Performance: 
   Vector Quantization Algorithm: 
By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 

 compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
 Compression Ratio = 18.7/4.28
			 = 4.36


Huffman Encoding Time Complexity:   

          The time complexity for encoding each unique character based on its frequency is O(nlog n).
Extracting minimum frequency from the priority queue takes place 2*(n-1) times and its complexity is O(log n). Thus the overall complexity is O(nlog n).
