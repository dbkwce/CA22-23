Huffman coding is a compression methods, that is useful in image and video compression .
When applying Huffman encoding technique on an Image, the source symbols can be either pixel intensities of the Image,
 or the output of an intensity mapping function.

The performance of the Huffman encoding algorithm is, 
therefore, 0.28/1 = 28% worse than optimal in this case.

 The idea of extended Huffman coding is to encode a sequence of source symbols instead of individual symbols.
 The time complexity for encoding each unique character based on its frequency is O(nlog n).
 Extracting minimum frequency from the priority queue takes place 2*(n-1) times and its complexity is O(log n).
 Thus the overall complexity is O(nlog n).
