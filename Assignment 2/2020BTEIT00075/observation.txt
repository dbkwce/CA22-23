Vector Quantization is carried out in three steps- encoder, channel and decoder. The schematic diagram of Vector Quantization is shown in Fig. 1. The diagram consists of three blocks in which each block has a different working principle. Block 1 is the encoder section which includes generation of image vectors, codebook generation and indexing. Image vectors are generated by subdividing the input image into immediate and non-overlapping blocks. Generation of efficient codebook is the major task in vector quantization. A codebook contains a group of codewords of size equal to non-overlapping block size. An algorithm is said to be better algorithm if its generated codebook is efficient. After a successful generation of the codebook, each vector is indexed with the index number from index table. These index numbers are transmitted to the receiver. Block 2 is the channel through which indexed numbers are transmitted to the receiver. Block 3 is a decoder section which includes index table, codebook and reconstructed image. The received indexed numbers are decoded with receiver index table. The codebook at the receiver is the same as that of transmitter codebook. The received index numbers are assigned to its corresponding codewords and these codewords are arranged in a manner that the size of the reconstructed image is the same as that of the input image
