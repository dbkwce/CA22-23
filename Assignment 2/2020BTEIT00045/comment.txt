Data compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the uncompressed size and compressed size: Thus, a representation that compresses a file's storage size from 10 MB to 2 MB has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, often notated as an explicit ratio, 5:1 (read "five" to "one"), or as an implicit ratio, 5/1.
Huffman encoding takes this idea to the extreme. Characters that occur most often, such the space and period, may be assigned as few as one or two bits.
The Observation was it takes more time to compress an image in Vector quantization while in Huffman coding does compression faster.
