 Images :
      i)  "original.jpg" (original and uncompressed) and "compressed.jpg' (original and commpressed).
      ii) Properties of "original.jpg" : 
                        Dimensions: 128x128 px
                        Size: 5.21 kB

      iii) Properties of "compressed.jpg" :
                        Dimensions: 80x78 px 
                        Size: 2.38 kB
                        
Performance: 

      Vector Quantization Algorithm: 
    
                              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = (5.21/ 2.35)
                                                =  2.2170212766


      Huffman Encoding Algorithm:   

            The encoding performance for the Huffman depends on the number of  bits present inside the image.

            Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree.
