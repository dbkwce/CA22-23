Vector Quantization and Huffman Encoding

Problem Statement: To use the Vector Quantization Algorithm to compressed an image.
                   Get the Huffman code of the input image using Huffman Encoding Algorithm.

Quantization means approximation.
Here for this I have chosen 240*240 pixels PNG image which of 2 kb originally.
I have compressed this image using vector quantization and the reconstructed size is 1 kb.

Files:
    Images:
    1.OriginalGreyImage.png is the image before compressing
    2.ReconstructedImg.png is the image after compressing

    Coding:
    1.VectorQuatization is the file written in Python which contains the code for compressing image.
    2.HuffmanEncoding is the file in Python.
        I have created these files by referring on the google and youTube.

    Observations:
        File is reduced from 2 kb to 1 kb after compression.
        Compression rate: Original image/Compressed image
                        = 2kb /1 kb
                        = 2

        The time complexity for Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn).
        n is the number of nodes of tree.
