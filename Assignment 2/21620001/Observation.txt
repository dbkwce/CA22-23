1. Original_img.png ->Dimensions: 128x128 px
                       Size: 7.36 kB
2. Compressed_img.png -> Dimensions: 80x78 px 
                        Size: 3.61 kB

By calculating the Compression Ratio of the image: 

                              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
						= 7.36/3.61
						=2.038


Huffman Encoding Time Complexity:The time complexity for encoding each unique character based on its frequency is O(nlog n).Extracting minimum frequency from the priority queue takes place 2*(n-1) times and its complexity is O(log n).
Thus the overall complexity is O(nlog n).
