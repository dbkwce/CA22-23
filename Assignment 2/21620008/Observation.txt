Vector Quantization

If the input image has 256 shades of gray, we can visualize the vector space as the [0,0]-[255,255] square in the plane. 
We can then take the two components of the vectors as XY coordinates and plot a dot for each vector found in the input image.


Performance of Huffman Coding

Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of unique characters. 
If there are n nodes, extractMin() is called 2*(n â€“ 1) times. extractMin() takes O(logn) time as it calles minHeapify(). 
So, overall complexity is O(nlogn).
If the input array is sorted, there exists a linear time algorithm.
