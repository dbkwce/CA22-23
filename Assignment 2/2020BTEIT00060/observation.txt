Images :
      i)  "input_image.png" (original and uncompressed) and "output_image.png' (original and compressed).
      ii) Properties of "input.jpg" : 
                        Dimensions: 128x128 px
                        Size: 6.56 kB

      iii) Properties of "output.jpg" :
                        Dimensions: 90x88 px 
                        Size: 3.61 kB
                    
Performance: 

      Vector Quantization Algorithm: 

                              compression ratio = (uncompressed image size / compressed image size)
                                                = (6.56/ 3.61)
                                                =  1.81717451
 
 Huffman Coding Algorithm : 
                 Time Complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn), where n is number of different nodes present inside the Huffman tree.
