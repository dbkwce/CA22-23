 for n sized array no of comparisons will be n-1 so when 
 n=5,then the max no of comparisons will be 4,
 n=10,then the max no of comparisons will be 9,
Time complexity=O(n logn)
Space complexity=O(n)

 n=50,then the max no of comparisons will be 49,
 n=100,then the max no of comparisons will be 99,
We can not decide the sequence of function executed from 'gprof' but we can count the no of calls generated for each function in the algorithm.
