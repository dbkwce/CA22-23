* Modules included -
1. partition
2. quickSort
3. swap

* Features of quick sort-
1. stable
2. Uses Divide anf conquer
3. It is inplace algorithm
4. Time complexity = O(nlogn)

1.) We cannot decide the sequence of function executed from 'gprof' but we can count the no of calls generated for each function in the algorithm. But we can include counter variable in the function
 
2.) for quickSort max number of comparisons can takes place are n-1 
 
3.)  The total Number of comparisons for(10,100,1000,10000) are -
 
 a. n=10,then the total no of comparisons will be 9,
 b. n=100,then the total no of comparisons will be 99,
 c. n=1000,then the total no of comparisons will be 999,
 d. n=10000,then the total no of comparisons will be 9999,

4.) The Space complexity of quicSort Algorithm is =O(n)
The Time complexity of quickSort Algorithm is =O(n logn)
