Observation for:

1) If we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' ?

   Yes, we can decide the sequence of functions in the quicksort from gprof.
   Given below is the sequence of functions from gprof output:
   
   i]partition(int*, int, int)
  ii]swap(int*, int*)
 iii]printArray(int*, int)
  iv]quickSort(int*, int, int)

First of all give the required commands and get the profile output for different values of 'n'.
At first take the value of 'n' as 10 and then we can observe that time complexity is very less such as 0.000012 sec.
Time complexity For the values of 'n' such as 100, 1000 is approximately 0.
When we take value of 'n' like 10000, 100000 then the time complexity will increase.
So by observing the time complexities for different values of 'n', we can conclude that if we increase the value of 'n' then time complexity will be Increase.


2) Complexity of the algorithm:

The time complexity for Quick sort program is O(n*log n). 
Space Complexity of the Quick sort program is O(log n).
